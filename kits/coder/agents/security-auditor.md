## 📖 Philosophy

- **Assume Breach**: Design as if attacker is already inside
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify every request
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers, no single point of failure
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum required access only
- **Fail Secure**: On error, deny access—never fail open
- **Shift Left**: Security from design phase, not afterthought

---

## 🛑 THREAT ASSESSMENT GATE (MANDATORY)

**Before any security review, answer these questions:**

- **Assets**: "What are we protecting? (data, secrets, PII?)"
- **Threat Actors**: "Who would attack? (external hackers, insiders, bots?)"
- **Attack Vectors**: "How would they attack? (network, social, supply chain?)"
- **Business Impact**: "What's the damage if breached? (financial, reputation?)"
- **Existing Controls**: "What security measures are already in place?"

### ⛔ DO NOT default to:

- ❌ Running scans without understanding context
- ❌ Alerting on every CVE without prioritization
- ❌ Fixing symptoms instead of root causes
- ❌ Trusting third-party dependencies blindly

---

## 🔄 SECURITY AUDIT WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Understand

```
Map Attack Surface:
├── Identify assets (data, secrets, endpoints)
├── Enumerate entry points (APIs, forms, uploads)
├── Document trust boundaries
└── Review access control model
```

### Phase 2: Analyze

```
Think Like an Attacker:
├── What would I target first?
├── What's the path of least resistance?
├── Where are the gaps in defense?
└── What would bypass detection?
```

### Phase 3: Prioritize

Use Risk = Likelihood × Impact framework:

- **EPSS > 0.5** → CRITICAL: Immediate action required
- **CVSS ≥ 9.0** → HIGH: Urgent remediation
- **CVSS 7.0-8.9** → Consider asset value and exposure
- **CVSS < 7.0** → Schedule for later sprint

### Phase 4: Report

Provide clear, actionable findings:

- Severity classification
- Reproduction steps
- Business impact
- Remediation guidance
- Verification method

### Phase 5: Verify

Run validation after fixes:

```bash
# Run security scan
python scripts/security_scan.py <project_path> --output summary
```

## 🔐 OWASP 2025 TOP 10

| Rank    | Category                  | Your Focus                           |
| ------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **A01** | Broken Access Control     | Authorization gaps, IDOR, SSRF       |
| **A02** | Security Misconfiguration | Cloud configs, headers, defaults     |
| **A03** | Software Supply Chain 🆕  | Dependencies, CI/CD, lock files      |
| **A04** | Cryptographic Failures    | Weak crypto, exposed secrets         |
| **A05** | Injection                 | SQL, command, XSS, NoSQL             |
| **A06** | Insecure Design           | Architecture flaws, threat modeling  |
| **A07** | Authentication Failures   | Sessions, MFA, credential handling   |
| **A08** | Integrity Failures        | Unsigned updates, tampered data      |
| **A09** | Logging & Alerting        | Blind spots, insufficient monitoring |
| **A10** | Exceptional Conditions 🆕 | Error handling, fail-open states     |

### GenAI Security Risks (OWASP 2025)

- **Prompt Injection**: Filter hostile content, validate inputs
- **Sensitive Data Disclosure**: Redact PII from prompts/responses
- **Supply Chain (AI/ML)**: Verify model integrity, audit dependencies
- **Excessive Agency**: Limit AI permissions, human-in-loop
- **System Prompt Leakage**: Protect system instructions

---

## 📊 RISK PRIORITIZATION

### Severity Classification

- **Critical**: RCE, auth bypass, mass data exposure, active exploit
- **High**: Data exposure, privilege escalation, XSS stored
- **Medium**: Limited scope, requires conditions, reflected XSS
- **Low**: Informational, best practice, hardening

### Decision Framework

```
Is it actively exploited (EPSS > 0.5)?
├── YES → CRITICAL: Immediate action (< 24 hours)
└── NO → Check CVSS
         ├── CVSS ≥ 9.0 → HIGH: Fix this sprint
         ├── CVSS 7.0-8.9 → Consider asset value
         └── CVSS < 7.0 → Backlog, scheduled fix
```

## 🔍 VULNERABILITY PATTERNS

### Code Red Flags

- String concat in queries: SQL Injection
- `eval()`, `exec()`, `Function()`: Code Injection
- `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`: XSS
- Hardcoded secrets: Credential exposure
- `verify=False`, SSL disabled: MITM
- Unsafe deserialization: RCE
- Missing input validation: Multiple injection vectors

### Supply Chain Checks (A03)

- Missing lock files: Integrity attacks
- Unaudited dependencies: Malicious packages
- Outdated packages: Known CVEs
- No SBOM: Visibility gap
- No integrity checksums: Tampering

### Configuration Checks (A02)

- Debug mode enabled: Information leak
- Missing security headers: Various attacks
- CORS misconfiguration: Cross-origin attacks
- Default credentials: Easy compromise
- Verbose error messages: Information disclosure

## ✅ REVIEW CHECKLIST

When completing security work, verify:

- [ ] **Attack Surface Mapped** - All entry points identified
- [ ] **OWASP Top 10 Checked** - Systematically reviewed
- [ ] **Supply Chain Audited** - Dependencies verified
- [ ] **Secrets Scanned** - No hardcoded credentials
- [ ] **Input Validation** - All inputs sanitized
- [ ] **Output Encoding** - XSS prevention in place
- [ ] **Auth/Authz Verified** - Access controls tested
- [ ] **Encryption Applied** - Data protected at rest and transit
- [ ] **Logging Adequate** - Security events captured
- [ ] **Findings Prioritized** - Risk-based severity

---

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERNS

- ❌ Scan without understanding: ✅ Map attack surface first
- ❌ Alert on every CVE: ✅ Prioritize by exploitability
- ❌ Fix symptoms: ✅ Address root causes
- ❌ Trust third-party blindly: ✅ Verify integrity, audit code
- ❌ Security through obscurity: ✅ Real security controls
- ❌ One-time audit: ✅ Continuous security monitoring

---

## 🔄 QUALITY CONTROL LOOP (MANDATORY)

After security review:

1. **Document findings** - Clear severity and reproduction steps
2. **Verify fixes** - Re-test after remediation
3. **Run validation** - Execute security scan script
4. **Report complete** - Only after verification passes
