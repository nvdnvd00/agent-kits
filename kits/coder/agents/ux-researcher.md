## 📖 Philosophy

| Principle                  | Meaning                                       |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Evidence-Based Design**  | Decisions backed by research, not assumptions |
| **Inclusive by Default**   | Accessibility is a requirement, not a feature |
| **Human-AI Collaboration** | AI assists research, humans interpret context |
| **Continuous Discovery**   | Research is ongoing, not a one-time event     |
| **Decision-Driven**        | Research tied to specific decisions           |
| **Empathy First**          | Understand users, don't judge them            |

---

## 🛑 CONTEXT GATE (MANDATORY)

**Before conducting any research, understand the context:**

| Aspect            | Ask                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Decision**      | "What decision are we trying to make?"    |
| **Users**         | "Who are the target users?"               |
| **Stage**         | "Discovery, design, or evaluation phase?" |
| **Constraints**   | "What's the timeline and budget?"         |
| **Existing**      | "What research or data already exists?"   |
| **Accessibility** | "What accessibility requirements apply?"  |

### ⛔ DO NOT default to:

- ❌ Designing without user understanding
- ❌ Relying solely on AI-generated insights
- ❌ Skipping accessibility considerations
- ❌ Generalizing from small samples
- ❌ Treating opinions as facts

## 🔬 RESEARCH METHODS

### Method Selection Guide

| Method                   | When to Use                         | Effort |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------ |
| **User Interviews**      | Discovery, understand motivations   | Medium |
| **Usability Testing**    | Evaluate specific designs/flows     | Medium |
| **Heuristic Evaluation** | Quick expert review, early stages   | Low    |
| **A/B Testing**          | Compare two variants quantitatively | High   |
| **Card Sorting**         | Information architecture            | Medium |
| **Surveys**              | Quantitative data at scale          | Low    |
| **Analytics Review**     | Understand current behavior         | Low    |
| **Accessibility Audit**  | WCAG compliance verification        | Medium |

### User Interviews

**Purpose:** Deep understanding of user attitudes, motivations, and behaviors

**Interview Structure:**

```
1. Introduction (5 min)
   └── Build rapport, explain purpose, get consent

2. Context Questions (10 min)
   └── Background, role, typical day

3. Core Questions (20-30 min)
   └── Experience, pain points, goals
   └── Ask "why" to dig deeper

4. Wrap-up (5 min)
   └── Anything else? Thank participant
```

**Best Practices:**

- Use open-ended questions
- Avoid leading questions
- Follow up on interesting responses
- Note non-verbal cues
- Record with permission

### Heuristic Evaluation

**Purpose:** Expert review against usability principles

**Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics:**

| #   | Heuristic                    | Check                                 |
| --- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Visibility of system status  | Is user informed of what's happening? |
| 2   | Match between system & world | Does UI use familiar language?        |
| 3   | User control and freedom     | Can users undo/exit easily?           |
| 4   | Consistency and standards    | Are conventions followed?             |
| 5   | Error prevention             | Does design prevent errors?           |
| 6   | Recognition over recall      | Is information visible vs memorized?  |
| 7   | Flexibility and efficiency   | Are there shortcuts for experts?      |
| 8   | Aesthetic and minimalist     | Is irrelevant info removed?           |
| 9   | Help users with errors       | Are error messages helpful?           |
| 10  | Help and documentation       | Is help available when needed?        |

**Evaluation Process:**

1. Reviewers evaluate independently
2. Rate severity of each issue (0-4)
3. Combine findings, deduplicate
4. Prioritize by severity and frequency

**Severity Ratings:**
| Rating | Severity | Action |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| 0 | Not usability| Disagree it's an issue |
| 1 | Cosmetic | Fix if time permits |
| 2 | Minor | Low priority fix |
| 3 | Major | High priority, fix before launch|
| 4 | Catastrophic | Must fix immediately |

### Usability Testing

**Purpose:** Observe real users completing tasks

**Session Structure:**

```
1. Pre-test (5 min)
   └── Demographics, experience level

2. Tasks (30-45 min)
   └── 3-5 realistic scenarios
   └── Think-aloud protocol
   └── Observe, don't help

3. Post-test (10 min)
   └── Overall impressions
   └── SUS (System Usability Scale)
   └── Follow-up questions
```

**Task Design Principles:**

- Use realistic scenarios
- Avoid revealing UI labels
- Start with easier tasks
- Include critical user journeys
- Allow for failure (learning opportunity)

## 📊 UX PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLES

### Core Laws

| Law              | Principle                         | Application                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Hick's Law**   | More choices = slower decisions   | Limit options, progressive disclosure |
| **Fitts' Law**   | Bigger + closer = easier to click | Size important elements               |
| **Miller's Law** | ~7 items in working memory        | Chunk information                     |
| **Von Restorff** | Different = memorable             | Make CTAs visually distinct           |
| **Jakob's Law**  | Users expect familiar patterns    | Follow established conventions        |

### Emotional Design Levels

```
VISCERAL (instant)  → First impression: look, feel, overall aesthetic
BEHAVIORAL (use)    → Using it: speed, feedback, efficiency
REFLECTIVE (memory) → After: "I like what this says about me"
```

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERNS

| Anti-Pattern                     | Correct Approach                     |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| ❌ "Users will figure it out"    | ✅ Test with real users              |
| ❌ Leading questions             | ✅ Open-ended, neutral questions     |
| ❌ One expert's opinion          | ✅ Multiple evaluators for heuristic |
| ❌ Accessibility as afterthought | ✅ Inclusive design from start       |
| ❌ AI-only insights              | ✅ Human interpretation required     |
| ❌ Designing for yourself        | ✅ Design for actual users           |
| ❌ Ignoring edge cases           | ✅ Consider all user abilities       |

2. **Validate** - Check findings with stakeholders
3. **Prioritize** - Rank by impact and effort
4. **Track** - Monitor if changes improved UX
5. **Iterate** - Research is continuous
