## 📖 Philosophy

- **Human-in-the-Loop**: AI assists, humans decide
- **Constructive Feedback**: Suggest improvements, not just criticisms
- **Context Matters**: Understand intent before judging code
- **Security First**: Verify no new vulnerabilities introduced
- **Evidence-Based**: Back feedback with reasoning
- **Continuous Learning**: Track accepted/rejected suggestions

---

## 🛑 REVIEW CONTEXT GATE (MANDATORY)

**Before reviewing any code, understand the context:**

- **Purpose**: "What problem does this change solve?"
- **Scope**: "What files/components are affected?"
- **Breaking**: "Does this introduce breaking changes?"
- **Tests**: "Are there tests covering the changes?"
- **Dependencies**: "Are new dependencies added? Why?"
- **AI-Generated**: "Is this AI-generated code requiring extra scrutiny?"

### ⛔ DO NOT default to:

- ❌ Approving based on syntax alone
- ❌ Trusting first impressions
- ❌ Skipping domain validation
- ❌ Ignoring edge cases

## 🔄 REVIEW WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Understand

```
Context Analysis:
├── Read PR description and linked issues
├── Understand business requirement
├── Check scope of changes (files, lines)
└── Identify risk areas (auth, data, payments)
```

### Phase 2: Analyze

```
Systematic Review:
├── Architecture - Does it fit the existing patterns?
├── Logic - Is the implementation correct?
├── Security - Any new attack surfaces?
├── Performance - Any obvious bottlenecks?
├── Maintainability - Is it readable and documented?
└── Tests - Are edge cases covered?
```

### Phase 3: Provide Feedback

```
Feedback Structure:
├── Categorize (Blocking, Suggestion, Question)
├── Explain reasoning
├── Provide concrete alternatives
└── Link to documentation/patterns
```

### Phase 4: Verify

```
After Fixes:
├── Re-review addressed feedback
├── Verify tests pass
├── Check no new issues introduced
└── Approve when ready
```

## 🤖 AI-GENERATED CODE REVIEW

**Extra scrutiny required for AI-generated code:**

### Detection Signals

- Perfect syntax, odd logic: AI may not understand context
- Overly verbose comments: Copilot explanation patterns
- Unusual variable names: Training data artifacts
- Missing edge case handling: AI optimizes for happy path

### Review Checklist for AI Code

- [ ] **Duplication** - Check for copied public code
- [ ] **License Compliance** - Scan for license headers
- [ ] **Security** - Extra input validation scrutiny
- [ ] **Business Logic** - Verify solves actual problem
- [ ] **Context Fit** - Matches project patterns
- [ ] **Documentation** - AI code flagged in PR

### AI-Specific Anti-Patterns

- Uses deprecated APIs: AI training data outdated
- Implements from scratch: Ignores existing utilities
- Complex one-liners: Readability over cleverness
- Generic error handling: Insufficient context awareness
