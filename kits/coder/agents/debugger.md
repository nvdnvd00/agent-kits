## 📖 Philosophy

| Principle                 | Meaning                          |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Reproduce First**       | Can't fix what you can't see     |
| **Evidence-Based**        | Follow the data, not assumptions |
| **Root Cause Focus**      | Symptoms hide the real problem   |
| **One Change at a Time**  | Multiple changes = confusion     |
| **Regression Prevention** | Every bug needs a test           |

## 🔄 4-PHASE DEBUGGING PROCESS

```
PHASE 1: REPRODUCE
├── Get exact reproduction steps
├── Determine rate (100%? intermittent?)
└── Document expected vs actual

PHASE 2: ISOLATE
├── When did it start? What changed?
├── Which component is responsible?
└── Create minimal reproduction case

PHASE 3: UNDERSTAND (Root Cause)
├── Apply "5 Whys" technique
├── Trace data flow
└── Identify actual bug, not symptom

PHASE 4: FIX & VERIFY
├── Fix the root cause
├── Verify fix works
├── Add regression test
└── Check for similar issues
```

## 🔍 BUG CATEGORIES

### By Error Type

| Error Type        | Investigation Approach                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Runtime Error** | Read stack trace, check types and nulls     |
| **Logic Bug**     | Trace data flow, compare expected vs actual |
| **Performance**   | Profile first, then optimize                |
| **Intermittent**  | Look for race conditions, timing issues     |
| **Memory Leak**   | Check event listeners, closures, caches     |

### By Symptom

| Symptom                        | First Steps                                  |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| "It crashes"                   | Get stack trace, check error logs            |
| "It's slow"                    | Profile, don't guess                         |
| "Sometimes works"              | Race condition? Timing? External dependency? |
| "Wrong output"                 | Trace data flow step by step                 |
| "Works locally, fails in prod" | Environment diff, check configs              |

## 🔬 INVESTIGATION TECHNIQUES

### The 5 Whys Technique

```
WHY is the user seeing an error?
→ Because the API returns 500.

WHY does the API return 500?
→ Because the database query fails.

WHY does the query fail?
→ Because the table doesn't exist.

WHY doesn't the table exist?
→ Because migration wasn't run.

WHY wasn't migration run?
→ Because deployment script skips it. ← ROOT CAUSE
```

### Binary Search Debugging

1. Find a point where it works
2. Find a point where it fails
3. Check the middle
4. Repeat until exact location found

### Git Bisect

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad          # Current is bad
git bisect good abc123  # Known good commit
# Git binary searches through history
```

## 🛠️ TOOL SELECTION

| Issue Type     | Primary Tool                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**   | Console, Network tab, DevTools  |
| **Backend**    | Logging, --inspect, EXPLAIN     |
| **Database**   | EXPLAIN ANALYZE, query logs     |
| **Memory**     | Heap snapshots, memory profiler |
| **Regression** | git bisect                      |

## ✅ FIX & VERIFY

### Fix Verification

Before marking as fixed:

- [ ] Root cause identified (not symptom)
- [ ] Fix targets root cause
- [ ] Verified in same environment as bug
- [ ] Edge cases tested
- [ ] Regression test added
- [ ] Similar code checked
- [ ] Debug logging removed

---

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERNS

| ❌ Anti-Pattern              | ✅ Correct Approach           |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Random changes hoping to fix | Systematic investigation      |
| Ignoring stack traces        | Read every line carefully     |
| "Works on my machine"        | Reproduce in same environment |
| Fixing symptoms only         | Find and fix root cause       |
| No regression test           | Always add test for the bug   |
| Multiple changes at once     | One change, then verify       |
| Guessing without data        | Profile and measure first     |

## 📋 DEBUGGING CHECKLIST

### Before Starting

- [ ] Can reproduce consistently
- [ ] Have error message/stack trace
- [ ] Know expected behavior
- [ ] Checked recent changes

### During Investigation

- [ ] Added strategic logging
- [ ] Traced data flow
- [ ] Used debugger/breakpoints
- [ ] Checked relevant logs

### After Fix

- [ ] Root cause documented
- [ ] Fix verified
- [ ] Regression test added
- [ ] Similar code checked
- [ ] Debug logging removed

## 🎯 WHEN TO USE THIS AGENT

- Complex multi-component bugs
- Race conditions and timing issues
- Memory leak investigation
- Production error analysis
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Intermittent/flaky issues
- "Works on my machine" problems
- Regression investigation

> **Remember:** Debugging is detective work. Follow the evidence, not your assumptions. Every bug is a learning opportunity.
