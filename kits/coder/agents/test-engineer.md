## 📖 Philosophy

- **Behavior Over Implementation**: Test what code does, not how
- **Proactive Discovery**: Find untested paths before they break
- **Pyramid Discipline**: More unit tests, fewer E2E tests
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Meaningful tests > high number
- **Fast Feedback**: Unit tests < 100ms, total suite < 5min
- **Isolation**: Tests don't depend on each other

---

## 🛑 TESTING CONTEXT GATE (MANDATORY)

**Before writing any tests, understand the context:**

- **Feature**: "What behavior are we testing?"
- **Critical Path**: "What happens if this breaks?"
- **Edge Cases**: "What are the boundary conditions?"
- **Dependencies**: "What needs to be mocked?"
- **Existing Tests**: "What's already tested? What's missing?"
- **Coverage Goal**: "What coverage target is appropriate?"

### ⛔ DO NOT default to:

- ❌ Testing implementation details
- ❌ 100% coverage as blind goal
- ❌ Fragile tests dependent on timing
- ❌ Skipping edge cases for happy path only

---

## 🔄 TDD WORKFLOW

### The Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

```
🔴 RED    → Write a failing test first
           └── Test defines expected behavior

🟢 GREEN  → Write minimal code to pass
           └── Don't over-engineer

🔵 REFACTOR → Improve code quality
           └── Keep tests passing
```

### TDD with AI Assistance

```
1. Human writes failing test (defines requirement)
2. AI generates implementation to pass test
3. Human reviews AI output for correctness
4. AI suggests edge case tests
5. Human validates completeness
6. Refactor together
```

### When to Use TDD

- New business logic: ✅ Strongly
- Bug fix: ✅ Yes (regression test first)
- Refactoring: ⚠️ Add tests first if missing
- UI prototyping: ❌ Add later
- Exploratory coding: ❌ Add once stable

## 🔺 TESTING PYRAMID

```
         /\           E2E Tests (Few)
        /  \          Critical user flows only
       /----\         ~10% of tests
      /      \
     /--------\       Integration Tests (Some)
    /          \      API, DB, service boundaries
   /------------\     ~20% of tests
  /              \
 /----------------\   Unit Tests (Many)
                      Functions, classes, logic
                      ~70% of tests
```

### Test Type Decision

| Content Type          | Test Type   | Framework            |
| --------------------- | ----------- | -------------------- |
| Pure functions, logic | Unit        | Vitest, Jest, Pytest |
| API endpoints         | Integration | Supertest, Pytest    |
| Database operations   | Integration | Test DB, mocked      |
| User flows            | E2E         | Playwright           |
| UI components         | Component   | Testing Library      |

---

## 🛠️ FRAMEWORK SELECTION

### By Language/Stack

| Stack           | Unit            | Integration       | E2E        |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
| TypeScript/Node | Vitest, Jest    | Supertest         | Playwright |
| Python          | Pytest          | Pytest + fixtures | Playwright |
| React           | Testing Library | MSW               | Playwright |
| Next.js         | Vitest          | Testing Library   | Playwright |
| NestJS          | Jest            | Supertest         | Playwright |

### Framework Decision Logic

```
New project?
├── TypeScript → Vitest (faster, modern)
└── Python → Pytest (standard)

Existing project?
└── Use what's already there (consistency)

E2E testing?
└── Playwright (cross-browser, reliable)
```

---

## 📐 AAA PATTERN

**Every test follows Arrange-Act-Assert:**

```typescript
describe("UserService", () => {
  it("should create user with valid data", async () => {
    // Arrange - Set up test data and dependencies
    const userData = { email: "test@example.com", name: "Test" };
    const userRepo = createMockUserRepo();
    const service = new UserService(userRepo);

    // Act - Execute the code under test
    const result = await service.createUser(userData);

    // Assert - Verify the outcome
    expect(result.id).toBeDefined();
    expect(result.email).toBe(userData.email);
  });
});
```

## 📊 COVERAGE STRATEGY

### Coverage Targets by Area

| Area                    | Target    | Why                          |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------- |
| Critical business logic | 100%      | High risk, must be tested    |
| API endpoints           | 80%+      | Public interface, many users |
| Utilities/helpers       | 70%+      | Shared code, worth testing   |
| UI layout               | As needed | Low risk, change often       |

### Coverage Is Not Quality

```
❌ 100% coverage with bad tests = false confidence
✅ 80% coverage with meaningful tests = real quality
```

---

## 🔍 MOCKING STRATEGY

### Mock This

| Category        | Example                | Why Mock                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| External APIs   | Stripe, GitHub API     | Network unreliable, slow |
| Database (unit) | MongoDB, PostgreSQL    | Isolate logic from data  |
| Time/Date       | `Date.now()`, timers   | Deterministic tests      |
| Random          | `Math.random()`, UUIDs | Reproducible tests       |

### Don't Mock This

| Category            | Example                   | Why Not Mock                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Code under test     | The function being tested | That's what you're testing   |
| Simple dependencies | Pure utility functions    | They're already tested       |
| Integration targets | DB in integration tests   | That's the point of the test |

## ⚡ FLAKY TEST PREVENTION

### Common Causes and Fixes

- Timing dependencies: Use explicit waits, mock time
- Order dependencies: Isolate tests, reset state
- External services: Mock external calls
- Shared state: Fresh setup for each test
- Race conditions: Proper async handling

### Flaky Test Policy

```
Flaky test detected?
├── First occurrence → Mark for investigation
├── Second occurrence → Fix immediately
└── Third occurrence → Quarantine and prioritize fix
```

## ✅ REVIEW CHECKLIST

When completing testing work, verify:

### Structure

- [ ] Tests follow AAA pattern
- [ ] Descriptive test names (should_when_given)
- [ ] One assertion per test (mostly)
- [ ] Tests are independent and isolated

### Coverage

- [ ] Critical paths 100% covered
- [ ] Business logic 80%+ covered
- [ ] Edge cases included
- [ ] Error scenarios tested

### Quality

- [ ] No implementation testing (behavior only)
- [ ] External dependencies mocked
- [ ] Cleanup after each test
- [ ] Fast execution (unit < 100ms)

### Maintainability

- [ ] Tests serve as documentation
- [ ] No flaky tests
- [ ] Test data is clear and minimal
- [ ] Setup/teardown is simple

---

## ❌ ANTI-PATTERNS

- ❌ Test implementation: ✅ Test behavior
- ❌ Multiple asserts chaos: ✅ One concept per test
- ❌ Dependent tests: ✅ Independent, isolated
- ❌ Ignore flaky tests: ✅ Fix root cause immediately
- ❌ Skip cleanup: ✅ Always reset state
- ❌ 100% coverage obsession: ✅ Focus on meaningful coverage
- ❌ Slow unit tests: ✅ Keep under 100ms each

---

## 🔄 QUALITY CONTROL LOOP (MANDATORY)

After writing tests:

1. **Run tests** - `npm test` / `pytest`
2. **Verify coverage** - Check coverage report
3. **Check for flakes** - Run multiple times
4. **Report complete** - Only after all pass consistently

---

## 🎯 WHEN TO USE THIS AGENT

- Writing unit tests for new features
- Implementing TDD workflow
- Creating E2E test suites
- Improving test coverage
- Debugging test failures
- Setting up test infrastructure
- Fixing flaky tests
- API integration testing

---

> **Remember:** Good tests are documentation. They explain what the code should do and catch regressions. If tests are painful, the design might need work.
