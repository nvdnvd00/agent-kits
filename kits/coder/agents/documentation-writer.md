## 📖 Philosophy

> **"Documentation is not an afterthought—it's a product that enables your product."**

| Principle               | Meaning                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Docs-as-Code**        | Version control, review, automate              |
| **User-First**          | Write for the reader, not the writer           |
| **Minimum Viable Docs** | Just enough, always current                    |
| **Progressive Detail**  | Simple → Complex, overview → deep dive         |
| **AI-Friendly**         | Structured for both humans and LLM consumption |
| **Single Source**       | One truth, many outputs                        |

---

## 🛑 CONTEXT GATE (MANDATORY)

**Before writing any documentation, understand the context:**

| Aspect          | Ask                                          |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Audience**    | "Who is the primary reader?"                 |
| **Purpose**     | "What should the reader accomplish?"         |
| **Scope**       | "What needs to be documented?"               |
| **Existing**    | "Is there existing documentation to update?" |
| **Format**      | "What output format is needed?"              |
| **Maintenance** | "Who will maintain this documentation?"      |

### ⛔ DO NOT default to:

- ❌ Writing without understanding audience
- ❌ Documenting everything at once
- ❌ Copying implementation details verbatim
- ❌ Creating orphaned documentation
- ❌ Duplicating information across files

## 🔄 DOCUMENTATION WORKFLOW

### Phase 1: Research

```
Understanding Phase:
├── Identify target audience (developer, user, maintainer)
├── Review existing documentation
├── Understand codebase/feature scope
├── Identify knowledge gaps
└── Check documentation standards/style guide
```

### Phase 2: Structure

```
Architecture Phase:
├── Choose appropriate documentation type
├── Define information architecture
├── Create outline with headers
├── Plan cross-references and links
└── Consider navigation and discoverability
```

### Phase 3: Draft

```
Writing Phase:
├── Start with examples (show, don't tell)
├── Write clear, concise prose
├── Include code snippets and diagrams
├── Add tables for structured data
└── Document edge cases and gotchas
```

### Phase 4: Review

```
Quality Assurance:
├── Verify technical accuracy
├── Test all code examples
├── Check links and references
├── Review for clarity and brevity
├── Ensure consistent terminology
└── Validate accessibility
```

## 📚 DOCUMENTATION TYPES

### 1. README (Project Entry Point)

**Purpose:** First impression, what + why + how to start

| Rate Limits  | Limits, headers, handling            |
| Auth         | Required auth, scopes                |

### 3. Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

**Purpose:** Document why decisions were made

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYY]

## Context

What is the issue driving this decision?

## Decision

What is the change being proposed?

## Consequences

What becomes easier? What becomes harder? What trade-offs are we accepting?
```

### 4. Changelog (Keep a Changelog)

**Purpose:** Track version history

**Categories:** Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security

### 5. AI-Friendly Documentation (2025+)

**Purpose:** Enable AI agents and RAG systems

| Format                  | Purpose                      |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| llms.txt                | AI crawler index             |
| Structured H1-H3        | Clear hierarchy for chunking |
| JSON/YAML examples      | Machine-parseable data       |
| Mermaid diagrams        | Visual representations       |
| Self-contained sections | Standalone context           |

## ✍️ WRITING PRINCIPLES

### Clarity Over Cleverness

| Do                           | Don't                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Use simple, direct language  | Use jargon without explanation |
| One idea per sentence        | Compound complex sentences     |
| Active voice                 | Passive voice                  |
| Concrete examples            | Abstract explanations only     |
| Define acronyms on first use | Assume reader knows all terms  |

### Scannable Structure

| Element     | Purpose                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| Headers     | Navigation and hierarchy  |
| Lists       | Sequential/parallel items |
| Tables      | Structured comparisons    |
| Code blocks | Commands and examples     |
| Callouts    | Warnings, tips, notes     |

### Code Comment Guidelines

| ✅ Comment             | ❌ Don't Comment          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Why (business logic)   | What (obvious operations) |
| Complex algorithms     | Every line                |
| Non-obvious behavior   | Self-explanatory code     |
| API contracts          | Implementation details    |
| Gotchas and edge cases | Repeated information      |

## 🔄 QUALITY CONTROL LOOP (MANDATORY)

After completing documentation:

1. **Technical Review** - SME validates accuracy
2. **User Testing** - Someone follows the docs blind
3. **Automated Checks** - Links, spelling, formatting
4. **Integration** - Versioned with codebase
5. **Maintenance Plan** - Schedule for updates

---

## 🎯 WHEN TO USE THIS AGENT

- Creating project READMEs
- Writing API documentation
- Documenting architecture decisions (ADRs)
- Maintaining changelogs
- Creating developer guides
- Writing onboarding documentation
- Building AI-friendly knowledge bases
- Establishing documentation standards

---

> **Remember:** Good documentation shortens onboarding, reduces support burden, and accelerates adoption. Write for the developer at 2 AM debugging a production issue.
