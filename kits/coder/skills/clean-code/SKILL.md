# Clean Code - Pragmatic AI Coding Standards

> **Philosophy:** Be **concise, direct, and solution-focused**. The user wants working code, not programming lessons.

---

## Core Principles

| Principle     | Rule                                                       |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **SRP**       | Single Responsibility - each function/class does ONE thing |
| **DRY**       | Don't Repeat Yourself - extract duplicates, reuse          |
| **KISS**      | Keep It Simple - simplest solution that works              |
| **YAGNI**     | You Aren't Gonna Need It - don't build unused features     |
| **Boy Scout** | Leave code cleaner than you found it                       |

---

## Naming Rules

| Element       | Convention                                            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Variables** | Reveal intent: `userCount` not `n`                    |
| **Functions** | Verb + noun: `getUserById()` not `user()`             |
| **Booleans**  | Question form: `isActive`, `hasPermission`, `canEdit` |
| **Constants** | SCREAMING_SNAKE: `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`                    |
| **Classes**   | PascalCase nouns: `UserService`, `PaymentGateway`     |
| **Files**     | kebab-case or camelCase based on project convention   |

> **Rule:** If you need a comment to explain a name, rename it.

---

## Function Rules

| Rule                   | Description                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Small**              | Max 20 lines, ideally 5-10            |
| **One Thing**          | Does one thing, does it well          |
| **One Level**          | One level of abstraction per function |
| **Few Args**           | Max 3 arguments, prefer 0-2           |
| **No Side Effects**    | Don't mutate inputs unexpectedly      |
| **Pure When Possible** | Same input → same output              |

---

## Code Structure

| Pattern            | Apply                                     |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Guard Clauses**  | Early returns for edge cases              |
| **Flat > Nested**  | Avoid deep nesting (max 2 levels)         |
| **Composition**    | Small functions composed together         |
| **Colocation**     | Keep related code close                   |
| **Vertical Slice** | Feature files together, not by layer type |

### Guard Clause Example

```typescript
// ❌ Nested
function processUser(user) {
  if (user) {
    if (user.isActive) {
      if (user.hasPermission) {
        // actual logic 3 levels deep
      }
    }
  }
}

// ✅ Guard Clauses
function processUser(user) {
  if (!user) return null;
  if (!user.isActive) return null;
  if (!user.hasPermission) return null;

  // actual logic at top level
}
```

## AI Coding Style

| Situation                 | Action                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| User asks for feature     | Write it directly                          |
| User reports bug          | Fix it, don't explain first                |
| No clear requirement      | Ask, don't assume                          |
| Multiple valid approaches | Pick one, mention alternatives if critical |

### Output Quality Rules

| Rule                 | Description                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **No Preamble**      | Skip "Here's the code..." - just write code |
| **No Postamble**     | Skip "This code does..." - let code speak   |
| **Minimal Comments** | Only for complex/non-obvious business logic |
| **Complete Code**    | No `// ... rest of code` placeholders       |
| **Test Immediately** | Run/verify code before claiming complete    |

---

## Error Handling Patterns

| Pattern            | When to Use                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Return Early**   | Validation failures, missing data       |
| **Throw Specific** | Domain errors, use custom error classes |
| **Try/Catch**      | External calls, I/O operations          |
| **Result Type**    | Complex operations, functional style    |

### Error Handling Example

```typescript
// ❌ Generic
throw new Error("Something went wrong");

// ✅ Specific
throw new UserNotFoundError(userId);
throw new InsufficientFundsError(amount, balance);
```

---

## Anti-Patterns (DON'T)

| ❌ Pattern                  | ✅ Fix                  |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Comment every line          | Delete obvious comments |
| Helper for one-liner        | Inline the code         |
| Factory for 2 objects       | Direct instantiation    |
| utils.ts with 1 function    | Put code where used     |
| "First we import..."        | Just write code         |
| Deep nesting (3+ levels)    | Guard clauses           |
| Magic numbers               | Named constants         |
| God functions (50+ lines)   | Split by responsibility |
| Premature optimization      | Make it work first      |
| Helper folder with 20 files | Colocate with features  |

## 🔴 Before Editing ANY File (THINK FIRST!)

**Before changing a file, ask yourself:**

| Question                        | Why                      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **What imports this file?**     | They might break         |
| **What does this file import?** | Interface changes        |
| **What tests cover this?**      | Tests might fail         |
| **Is this a shared component?** | Multiple places affected |

**Quick Check:**

```
File to edit: UserService.ts
└── Who imports this? → UserController.ts, AuthController.ts
└── Do they need changes too? → Check function signatures
```

> 🔴 **Rule:** Edit the file + all dependent files in the SAME task.
> 🔴 **Never leave broken imports or missing updates.**

## Summary

| Do                     | Don't                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Write code directly    | Write tutorials            |
| Let code self-document | Add obvious comments       |
| Fix bugs immediately   | Explain the fix first      |
| Inline small things    | Create unnecessary files   |
| Name things clearly    | Use abbreviations          |
| Keep functions small   | Write 100+ line functions  |
| Verify code works      | Claim done without testing |

---

## 🔴 Self-Check Before Completing (MANDATORY)

**Before saying "task complete", verify:**

| Check                     | Question                          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Goal met?**          | Did I do exactly what user asked? |
| ✅ **Files edited?**      | Did I modify all necessary files? |
| ✅ **Code works?**        | Did I test/verify the change?     |
| ✅ **No errors?**         | Lint and TypeScript pass?         |
| ✅ **Nothing forgotten?** | Any edge cases missed?            |

> 🔴 **Rule:** If ANY check fails, fix it before completing.

## Decision Trees

### When to Abstract?

```
Is code duplicated 3+ times?
├── Yes → Extract function/component
└── No → Is code complex AND reusable?
    ├── Yes → Extract with clear interface
    └── No → Keep inline
```

### When to Comment?

```
Is logic non-obvious?
├── No → Don't comment
└── Yes → Is it business logic or algorithm?
    ├── Business logic → Comment the WHY
    └── Algorithm → Link to reference + brief WHY
```
