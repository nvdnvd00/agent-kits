# Prompt Engineering - AI Communication Excellence

## ⚡ Quick Reference

- **Structure**: Role → Task → Format → Constraints → Examples → Output format
- **Be specific**: Vague prompt = vague output · specify length, format, tone, audience
- **Chain of Thought**: "Think step by step" for complex reasoning · "First, list..." for structured output
- **Few-shot**: 2-5 examples beats 1000-word description · Show don't tell
- **Iteration**: Start simple → add constraints → refine · Save effective prompts as templates
- **System prompt**: Set persona + rules + format once · User message = task only

## Core Principles

- **Specific**: Ambiguity causes inconsistent outputs
- **Structured**: Clear sections: Context → Task → Format → Examples
- **Testable**: Evaluate on diverse inputs, measure consistency
- **Iterative**: Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- **Versioned**: Treat prompts as code with proper version control

## Prompt Structure

### Universal Template

```
[ROLE/PERSONA]     → Who the AI should be
[CONTEXT]          → Background information
[TASK]             → What to do
[CONSTRAINTS]      → Rules and boundaries
[FORMAT]           → Expected output structure
[EXAMPLES]         → Input-output demonstrations
```

### System Prompt Example

```markdown
# Role

You are a senior backend engineer specializing in API design.

# Rules

- Always consider scalability and performance
- Suggest RESTful patterns by default
- Flag security concerns immediately
- Use early return pattern in code

# Output Format

1. Analysis
2. Recommendation
3. Code example
4. Trade-offs
```

## Key Techniques

### 1. Few-Shot Learning

- Consistent formatting: 2-3 examples
- Complex reasoning patterns: 3-5 examples
- Edge case handling: Include edge cases
- Simple tasks: 0-1 examples

```markdown
Extract key information:

Input: "Login error 403, can't access dashboard"
Output: {"issue": "auth", "code": 403, "priority": "high"}

Input: "Feature request: add dark mode"
Output: {"issue": "feature", "code": null, "priority": "low"}

Now process: "Can't upload files, timeout after 10s"
```

### 2. Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

Force step-by-step reasoning for complex problems:

```markdown
Analyze this bug report.

Think step by step:

1. What is the expected behavior?
2. What is the actual behavior?
3. What changed recently?
4. What components are involved?
5. What is the most likely root cause?

Bug: "Users can't save drafts after cache update"
```

| CoT Type       | Trigger                    | Accuracy Boost |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Zero-shot**  | "Let's think step by step" | +10-20%        |
| **Few-shot**   | Show reasoning examples    | +30-50%        |
| **Self-check** | "Verify your reasoning"    | +10-15%        |

### 3. Progressive Disclosure

Start simple, add complexity only when needed:

| Level | Prompt                                        | Use When         |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 1     | "Summarize this article"                      | Testing baseline |
| 2     | "Summarize in 3 bullet points"                | Need structure   |
| 3     | "Identify main findings, then summarize each" | Need reasoning   |
| 4     | Include 2-3 example summaries                 | Need consistency |

## Agent Prompt Patterns

### Persona Definition

```markdown
# Identity

You are [ROLE] with expertise in [DOMAIN].

# Philosophy

> "[CORE BELIEF]"

# Behavioral Traits

- [Trait 1]
- [Trait 2]
- [Trait 3]

# Anti-Patterns (What NOT to do)

- ❌ [Bad behavior 1]
- ❌ [Bad behavior 2]
```

### Decision Framework

```markdown
When [SITUATION]:

1. First, check [CONDITION_1]
2. If true → [ACTION_1]
3. If false → Check [CONDITION_2]
4. Default → [FALLBACK_ACTION]
```

### Error Recovery

```markdown
If uncertain:

- Request clarification with specific questions
- Provide confidence score (1-10)
- Offer alternative interpretations
- Indicate missing information clearly
```

## Optimization Techniques

| Technique             | Purpose                 | Example                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Constraints**       | Limit output scope      | "Max 100 words"               |
| **Format specs**      | Ensure parseable output | "Respond in JSON"             |
| **Role priming**      | Set expertise level     | "As a senior engineer..."     |
| **Negative examples** | What NOT to do          | "Do NOT include explanations" |
| **Confidence scores** | Measure certainty       | "Rate your confidence 1-10"   |

### Token Efficiency

- Long verbose instructions: Concise, direct commands
- Repeating context in every message: System prompt for stable context
- 10 examples when 3 suffice: Minimal effective examples

## Decision Trees

### When to Use Few-Shot?

```
Is output format critical?
├── Yes → Add 2-3 format examples
└── No → Is task complex?
    ├── Yes → Add reasoning examples
    └── No → Zero-shot often sufficient
```

### How Many Examples?

```
Task complexity?
├── Simple formatting → 2 examples
├── Complex reasoning → 3-5 examples
└── Novel task → Start with 5, reduce if consistent
```

---

## Anti-Patterns (DON'T)

- Vague instructions: Specific, measurable requirements
- Complex prompt from start: Start simple, iterate
- Examples that don't match task: Representative, diverse examples
- No output format specified: Clear format expectations
- Ignoring edge cases: Test on boundary inputs
- Same prompt for all tasks: Task-specific optimized prompts
- No version control: Git-track prompts like code

---

## Testing Prompts

| Test Type       | Purpose                  | Method                          |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **Consistency** | Same input → same output | Run 5x, check variance          |
| **Edge cases**  | Handle unusual inputs    | Test empty, long, special chars |
| **Adversarial** | Resist manipulation      | Test injection attempts         |
| **Performance** | Speed and token usage    | Measure latency, token count    |

### Prompt Evaluation Checklist

```
□ Clear role/persona defined?
□ Task instructions specific?
□ Output format specified?
□ Constraints explicit?
□ Examples representative?
□ Edge cases handled?
□ Error recovery defined?
```

> **Remember:** A well-crafted prompt is invisible - the AI just does what you need without confusion. If you're constantly rephrasing or clarifying, the prompt needs work.
