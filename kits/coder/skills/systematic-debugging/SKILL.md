# Systematic Debugging - Scientific Defect Resolution

> **Philosophy:** Debugging is detective work. Gather evidence, form hypotheses, test systematically.

---

## 🎯 Core Principle: Scientific Method for Bugs

```
❌ WRONG: Change random things → Hope it works → Repeat
✅ CORRECT: Observe → Hypothesize → Predict → Test → Verify
```

**The Scientific Debugging Approach:**

- Every change must be driven by a testable hypothesis
- One variable at a time
- Document evidence and outcomes
- Root cause, not symptom treatment

---

## 🔄 The 4-Phase Debugging Workflow

### Phase Overview

```
PHASE 1: REPRODUCE     → Reliably trigger the bug
    ↓
PHASE 2: DIAGNOSE      → Gather evidence, form hypotheses
    ↓
PHASE 3: FIX           → Apply targeted fix
    ↓
PHASE 4: VERIFY        → Confirm fix, prevent regression
```

---

## 📍 Phase 1: Reproduce

### Goal: Create a Minimal, Reliable Reproduction

**Without reliable reproduction, debugging is guessing.**

### Reproduction Checklist

```markdown
- [ ] Can trigger bug consistently (>90% success rate)
- [ ] Identified minimum steps to reproduce
- [ ] Know environment conditions (OS, browser, versions)
- [ ] Have isolated from unrelated factors
- [ ] Created automated test case if possible
```

### Information Gathering Template

```markdown
## Bug Reproduction Details

**Reported Behavior:** [What user/test observed]

**Expected Behavior:** [What should happen]

**Environment:**

- OS: [e.g., macOS 14.2]
- Runtime: [e.g., Node 20.10.0]
- Dependencies: [Key versions]

**Reproduction Steps:**

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Observe: Expected X, Got Y]

**Frequency:** [Always / Intermittent / Random]

**First Occurred:** [When / after what change]
```

### Handling Intermittent Bugs

| Pattern              | Investigation Approach                  |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Race condition       | Add timing logs, check for async issues |
| Memory-related       | Check for uninitialized variables       |
| State-dependent      | Log state at failure points             |
| Environment-specific | Compare configurations                  |
| Load-dependent       | Test under high load/concurrency        |

### If Bug Won't Reproduce

1. Check if bug is already fixed
2. Review recent code changes (git log)
3. Compare environments in detail
4. Add defensive logging for next occurrence
5. Set up alerts to capture live failure

## 🔬 Phase 2: Diagnose

### Goal: Identify Root Cause Through Evidence

### The Hypothesis Cycle

```
    ┌────────────────────────────────┐
    │         OBSERVE                │
    │   (Gather evidence/data)       │
    └──────────────┬─────────────────┘
                   ↓
    ┌────────────────────────────────┐
    │       HYPOTHESIZE              │
    │   (What could cause this?)     │
    └──────────────┬─────────────────┘
                   ↓
    ┌────────────────────────────────┐
    │         PREDICT                │
    │   (If hypothesis true, then..) │
    └──────────────┬─────────────────┘
                   ↓
    ┌────────────────────────────────┐
    │          TEST                  │
    │   (Run experiment)             │
    └──────────────┬─────────────────┘
                   ↓
             ┌─────┴─────┐
        Confirmed?   Refuted?
             ↓           ↓
         Refine      New Hypothesis
```

### Evidence Gathering Techniques

| Technique                | When to Use                        | How                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Strategic Logging**    | Understanding execution flow       | Add logs at decision points     |
| **Debugger Breakpoints** | Inspecting state at specific point | Set conditional breakpoints     |
| **Binary Search**        | Large codebase, unclear location   | Comment out half, narrow down   |
| **Stack Trace Analysis** | Exception/crash occurred           | Read trace bottom-up            |
| **Git Bisect**           | Bug appeared in recent commits     | Automate finding bad commit     |
| **Diff Analysis**        | Recently working code broke        | Compare working vs broken code  |
| **Rubber Duck**          | Logic seems correct but isn't      | Explain code line by line aloud |

### Hypothesis Documentation

```markdown
## Hypothesis #1: [Title]

**Statement:** [What you think is wrong]

**Evidence For:**

- [Supporting observation 1]
- [Supporting observation 2]

**Evidence Against:**

- [Contradicting observation if any]

**Test Plan:**

- [How to confirm or refute this]

**Prediction:**

- If true: [Expected observation]
- If false: [What we'd see instead]

**Result:** ✅ Confirmed / ❌ Refuted / 🔄 Needs more data
```

### Root Cause Categories

| Category          | Examples                              | Investigation Focus           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Logic Error**   | Wrong condition, off-by-one           | Step through logic carefully  |
| **State Problem** | Race condition, stale cache           | Track state changes over time |
| **Data Issue**    | Invalid input, null reference         | Inspect data at boundaries    |
| **Integration**   | API contract broken, version mismatch | Check integration points      |
| **Resource**      | Leak, exhaustion, timeout             | Monitor resource usage        |
| **Configuration** | Wrong env var, missing setting        | Compare environments          |

### 5 Whys Analysis

```markdown
## 5 Whys: [Bug Title]

1. **Why** did [observed failure occur]?
   → Because [immediate cause]

2. **Why** did [immediate cause] happen?
   → Because [deeper cause]

3. **Why** did [deeper cause] happen?
   → Because [even deeper cause]

## 🛠️ Debugging Tools & Techniques

### Tool Selection Guide

| Situation              | Tool/Technique | Command/Usage                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Find when bug appeared | Git Bisect     | `git bisect start; git bisect bad` |
| Trace execution path   | Debugger       | Set breakpoints, step through      |
| Find pattern in code   | Grep/Ripgrep   | `rg "pattern" --type ts`           |
| Profile performance    | Profiler       | Chrome DevTools, `node --prof`     |
| Monitor network        | Network tab    | Check request/response             |
| Find recent changes    | Git log/blame  | `git log -p --since="2 days ago"`  |

### Strategic Logging

```typescript
// Good: Context-rich, actionable logs
logger.debug("Processing order", {
  orderId,
  userId,
  itemCount: items.length,
  totalAmount,
});

// Bad: Vague, unhelpful
console.log("here"); // ❌
console.log(data); // ❌ No context
```

### Binary Search Debugging

```
Step 1: Identify a working point and broken point
Step 2: Test the midpoint
Step 3: If midpoint works → bug is after
        If midpoint broken → bug is before
Step 4: Repeat until bug location is isolated
```

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Change random things       | Test one hypothesis at a time               |
| Fix the symptom            | Find and fix root cause                     |

| Hope it's fixed            | Verify with tests                           |
| Fix and forget             | Document and add regression test            |
| Debug in production        | Reproduce in safe environment when possible |
| Remove code until it works | Understand why code was there               |
| Assume the obvious cause   | Test each hypothesis with evidence          |
